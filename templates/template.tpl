Modern science and some religious teachings have trained our society to ignore messages that do not emanate from a recognized source.  Yet, there is ample evidence showing that there may very well be other dimensions of which we are not presently aware.  Controlled laboratory experiments indicate that not only is there an afterlife, but after death we retain many personality traits and memories.</p><h1 class="rgt">THE SIGN REGISRTY IS YOUR<span> gateway </span>TO PERSONAL PROOF</h1><p>On this site you can &#8220;register&#8221; a sign that you plan on communicating to a loved one after you physically die.  Forever Family Foundation will store this information and will notify your designated loved one that you have registered a sign with The Sign Registry.  Upon your passing, if your designated loved one believes that they have received a ?sign,? they can log onto our site to determine if this communication was in fact the same sign that you registered.  You may be providing the greatest gift of all...</p><h1>THE<span> knowledge </span>TO YOUR LOVED ONES THAT YOU ARE STILL WITH THEM</h1><p class="noindent">Over time this data will provide the greatest method for evidence of survival of consciousness... You can be part of it!</p><p class="noindent">To get started, go to the Registration Room</p><div class="lr"><a href="index.php?mode=reg"><img src="templates/img/splash/reg-room.png" alt="Registration Room" border="0" /></a><span><a href="index.php?mode=valStart"><img src="templates/img/splash/val-room.png" alt="Validation Room" /></a></span></div><blockquote><strong>The Sign Registry</strong> is part of <strong>Forever Family Foundation</strong>, a non-profit, non-sectarian organization that supports the premise that life does not end with physical death; offering support to the bereaved, and furthering the understanding of Afterlife Science and survival of consciousness.
